## Exercise 1
In Biology, the process called mitosis is a part of the cell cycle, in which chromosomes are replicated and separated into two new nuclei. This is a process which only occurs in certain types of cells, called eukaryotic cells. Most animals undergo this type of mitosis, although the process can vary between one animal and the next. Errors sometimes occur during this process, which is how many forms of cancer come to be. These are typically caused by having too few or too many chromosomes in the duplicated cells. Some organisms also use mitosis as a form of reproduction.
## Exercise 2
The Treaty of Versailles was a treaty signed between Germany and the Allied powers at the end of the First World War. The treaty stated, among other things, that Germany bore responsibility for starting the war, and was responsible for paying reparations to compensate the Allies for their financial losses. It also forced Germany to cede important territories and to disarm, in order to prevent the outbreak of further hostilities. Many historians blame the overly draconian terms of the treaty for the outbreak of WWII, as it humiliated Germany and allowed Hitler to come to power on a promise of restoring the country and avenging its humiliations.
## Exercise 3
The university is pleased to announce that once again, we will be organising a four-day trip to New York City during the Spring Break. Weâ€™ve put this event on every year for the past seven, and participation has been great each year. This year, we will be visiting two museums and going to the new theme park which has just opened near LaGuardia airport.
Interested students should go to the Student Union office on the third floor of the Maxwell building for more information.
## Exercise 4
The University's international relations department announced last Monday that it will implement fees for international students. "This measure is in agreement with other countries and aims to balance the accounts of our University", reported the Director of the Department. "It is important to note that students from other countries who are already enrolled will not be affected. The measure goes into effect in 2021". In addition, the University announced a distinction between undergraduate and graduate courses. "We decided to charge an amount 30% and 50% higher for Master and Doctoral students respectively", explained the director. "For us, it makes more sense than an experienced student who is more likely to work and can pay more."
