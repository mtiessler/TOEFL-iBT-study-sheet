# Q
Some people believe that a healthy diet is the most important way to stay healthy. Others maintain that exercise is more important. Which opinion do you most agree with? Explain why.
# A
This theme seems to be very controversial nowadays. All the people I meet at school seems to have a very strong side towards one of the both ways to stay healthy but I don´t think any of the two sides are totally correct. My opinion leans more in the middle, a balance between food and sport is needed as both are fundamental. ==Firstly==, the amount of food you eat should be totally proportional to the amount of effort and sport you do. ==However==, it is also important to have a good diet, as eating junk food and sweets are not going to provide your body with the enough nutrients to recover from the sport and build a healthy body.



# Q
Some people believe that competing against themselves and reaching personal goals while practicing physical activities is beneficial. Others prefer to enjoy and have fun while doing exercises. Which behavior do you think is better?
# A
In a sense both are a good way of enjoying exercise. At the end, anyone should enjoy their life and their activities the way they love. If you ask me, I should point that competition leads to a better outcome in the personal sense, if the person or child playing is able to not enter in toxic traits. I find this last point quite important, toxicity and overvaluation of the sport or activity can end up making a heavy toll in the subject as it alienates the aim of the activity itself and becomes more a focus to hurt other ones and oneself.

From my point of view, I do believe that having fun is absolutely essential when we are practicing some physical activity. I remember I used to be extremely competitive when I was a teenager. I constantly compared myself with my friends, trying to catch up with them in all activities, be it swimming, baseball, running or even chess and, in addition, I tried to excel myself too. Nowadays I think that a physical activity must be accompanied by the pleasure of doing it. That is the reason why I try to do it every day. For example, instead of looking at the timer when I am running in the park, I just close my eyes and feel my own breath or I watch the beautiful scenery and this is extremely exciting for me.

# Q
Some people prefer waking up early while others like to stay in bed for as long as possible in the morning. Which do you prefer? Explain why.

I definitely prefer to stay in bed for as long as possible in the morning and there are a few reasons for this. Firstly, if I don’t get enough sleep then I am really tired and it’s just a lot harder for my brain to function properly during the day. Secondly, I think waking up too early means that people are too stressed and don’t appreciate the importance of relaxation. People I know who wake up early aren’t able to kick back and put their feet up for even a second. They always have to be doing something. Of course, if you have young children, then maybe you don’t have much choice about when you’re going to wake up! Personally, I think that the more you sleep, the more refreshed and ready you’ll feel.

# Q
Some people think that price is the most important thing to consider when buying something. Others think that quality is more important. Which do you think is more important?
# A
## SA
Well, for me personally I believe both are important. I don’t mind paying more for a product if I know that it’s made of much higher quality materials. However, there are limits to that where you might have two products where one is twice the price of the other, but it’s only slightly higher in quality. In that case, it is more practical to make do with the cheaper product than to pay double for a similar product. This is why most people don’t buy the most expensive, luxury goods, because the price is far higher relative to the quality of the product. The only people who buy such things are people who aren’t worried about costs but care more about quality and brand names than anything else. So, I think it’s ultimately about value, and balancing the quality of a product in relation to its

# Q
Some people prefer speaking more when discussing things with friends. Others prefer to listen. Which do you think is better? Explain why.
# A
## SA
Well, personally speaking, I would say that listening is preferable to speaking in discussion. Nowadays, most people just wait for their turn to speak rather than actually paying attention to what others say. Some people are of course more extroverted than others and will converse more, but it is possible to take this too far where it becomes a sign of selfishness and arrogance. I mean what is the point of having a conversation with someone who doesn’t care about what you say? I think ultimately if you listen and make an attempt to understand others, then you’ll naturally be invited to speak because people will value what you say more. Where I’m from, listening is a sign of wisdom. It shows respect, a humility about yourself and a willingness to learn.
