#### Exercise 1
Both the reading and the lecture encompass the concept of death penalty and if it should or should not be banned.
Initially the professor manifests that the state should be responsible for those who cause disorder instead of just killing them. In the other hand, in the text we can read that the best option that the state has is to kill the offender in order to keep society safe.
Moreover, the teacher indicates that two thirds of the countries no longer support death penalty. Not only that but also, as a result, crime rates have decreased. In the reading however, it is said that death penalty would be the only way to keep crime rates low.
Finally, the teacher expresses that even in capital crimes where families have passed through a lot of suffering, death penalty is not the solution for it. Indeed, it does not relief the suffering, but also it is extended with the death of another human being. Thus, in the reading it is stated that the only way to find peace for the family would be by seeing the killer being executed.

#### Exercise 2
I totally agree with Megan's opinion whereas I respectfully disagree with Troy's one. I hold the view that economic inequality increases social injustice and impacts negatively everyone in society. An essential argument perhaps is that by having inequality, purchasing power gets unequally distributed in society. As a result, poor people have less income and rich people have more. This turns out to be a vicious cycle ending in a huge gap between low and high classes. Not only that but also making the middle class disappear. Moreover, when inequality is present, the tax income for the country dwingles. As a result, there is less expenditure in essential services such as healthcare, infraestructure among many others.
