### Mock exam 2
#### Exercise 1
Both the reading and the lecture encompass the concept of **the** death penalty and if it should or should not be banned.
Initially the professor manifests that the state should be responsible for those who cause disorder instead of just killing them. **On** the other hand, in the text we can read that the best option that the state has is to kill the offender in order to keep society safe.
Moreover, the teacher indicates that two thirds of the countries no longer support death penalty. Not only that but also, as a result, crime rates have decreased. In the reading however, it is said that death penalty would be the only way to keep crime rates low.
Finally, the teacher expresses that even in capital crimes where families have passed through a lot of suffering, death penalty is not the solution for it. Indeed, it does not relief the suffering, but also it is extended with the death of another human being. Thus, in the reading it is stated that the only way to find peace for the family would be by seeing the killer being executed.

#### Exercise 2
I totally agree with Megan's opinion whereas I respectfully disagree with Troy's one. 
I hold the view that economic inequality increases social injustice and impacts negatively **on** everyone **in** society. 
An essential argument perhaps is that by having inequality, purchasing power gets unequally distributed **in** society. 
As a result, poor people have less income and rich people have more. This turns out to be a vicious cycle ending in a huge gap between low and high classes. 
Not only that but also making the middle class disappear. Moreover, when inequality is present, the tax income for the country dwingles. 
As a result, there is less expenditure in essential services such as healthcare, infraestructure among many others.

### Mock exam 3
#### Exercise 1
Both the lecture and the **reading** encompass the concept of the "whipping boy" and its historical origins. 
The teacher manifests that there is no real **evidence**~~s~~ on the historical references that the reading illustrates. 
To begin with, the professor explains that Fitzpatrick was not Edward's fall guy. 
In fact, according to the teacher, sometimes even Edward VI got hit. However, in the reading it can be read that Fitzpatrick was the one punished when Edward VI commi**t**ted crimes. 
Moreover, regarding Charles I and his whipping boy, in the lecture it is stated that the first reference towards William Murray being Charles I whipping boy appeared seventeen years after **the** king's death. 
Indeed, according to the professor, Samuel R. the one who wrote those references, was the author of one of the earliest stories related to the whipping boys, which ~~can turn out to be kind of suspicious~~ can be debatable. 
On the other hand, the reading affirms as a matter of fact, that William was Charles I whipping boy. 
Finally, "The Prince and the Pauper" which popularized the term, is pure fiction according to the teacher. 
As a result, in his opinion, it is important to take with a grain of salt the reading and what is explained there.

#### Exercise 2
I agree with Jessica's opinion whereas I respectfully disagree with Ethan's one. 
I hold the view that standardized testing is necessary and not only that but also, it must remain as the way to evaluate student**s** on important matters. 
An essential argument perhaps is that by standardizing, we can filter, rank easily and in a better way students with an objective point of view. 
By setting objective performance indicators, we can fairly say that one student is better than another. Moreover, standar**d**ization gets rid off subjective evaluations which in fact, can turn out to be unfair. 
For example, saying that a student is better than another because of its creativity, is something that will depend on the ~~examinator~~ examiner. 
As a result, depending on the **examiner** there will be different **criteria**~~s~~, which will result in an unfair grading.

### Practice 
#### Exercise 1
Both the lecture and the reading encompass the concept of "Fast fashion" and the role the Gen Z youngsters are playing in it. 
To begin with, the teacher manifests that the Gen Z is fully committed towards fighting climate change, whereas the reading illustrates that the Gen Z people do not care at all about that. 
Moreover, the professor opines that they are trying, more than ever, to shift shopping habits. She adds that it is very common nowadays to see them buying second hand clothes in online platforms such as "Vinted" and as a result, fast fashion is being replaced by an eco friendly movement. 
On the other hand, the reading exemplifies this young people as people who are just seeking cheap and accessible clothing for their own sake without caring about the impact they may generate. 
Finally, the teacher illustrates how social media is in fact having a positive impact in the Gen Z people. She states that nowadays TikTok has fashion trends that promote the recycling of old clothes. 
On the other hand, in the reading it can be read that young people contribute towards fast fashion, and as a result, they are constantly buying new clothes which will be used for creating new posts in the social media.

##### Correction
The reading passage discusses the negative aspects of "fast fashion," highlighting its impact on both people and the environment. 
It mentions low wages for factory workers, excessive waste production, and environmental pollution, while also expressing concerns about Gen Z's apparent disregard for these issues.
In contrast, the lecture challenges some of these assumptions and offers a more positive perspective on Gen Z's approach to fashion. 
The lecturer acknowledges the presence of Gen Z activists in climate change movements like Extinction Rebellion and their increasing involvement in politics. 
The lecture emphasizes that Gen Z is not just talking about change but actively altering their shopping behaviors.
The lecture provides examples of these changes, such as the growing popularity of renting items and buying second-hand clothing from platforms like Depop and Vinted. 
Gen Z is portrayed as seeking individuality and eco-friendly options rather than mindlessly supporting fast fashion. 
Social media, particularly TikTok, plays a role in promoting recycling and sustainable fashion trends among Gen Z.

#### Exercise 2
I completely agree with both David and Rachel's opinions. In addition to those, I consider that one of the majors strengths of democracy is that it **encompasses** a huge amount of different ideologies. 
As a result, progress comes from extracting the best ideas from each one of them. 
However, I would say that one of the greatest pitfalls from democracy is the easiness in which every adult can vote. 
Consequently, this can lead to situations where people without any basic knowledge of how the democratic system works, can vote without knowing what they are really voting. 
As a result, the results of elections can be random. 
For **addressing** this issue I consider that people should do a crash course about democracy and the political parties before being able to vote.

##### Correction
Response briefly mentions a strength and a weakness of democracy, but it lacks in-depth analysis or examples to support your points. You could provide more detailed explanations to strengthen your argument.

### Practice
#### Exercise 1
Both the lecture and the reading encompass about Hydroponics. 
While the author of the article argues that Hydroponics is an incredible alternative to traditional farming, thanks to some benefits such as high profitability, capacity to plant without taking into account the weather and the high quality of the resulting crops, the lecturer opposes the claims presented in the article. 
His position is that Hydroponics is far from being an alternative solution to traditional agriculture. 

To begin with, according to the reading, with Hydroponics, the crops can be cultivated everywhere. 
This argument is challenged by the professor.
He manifests that some crops are reliant on soil, specially those that have big roots. An example could be potatoes. 

Moreover, the author indicates that with Hydroponics, crops do not need any kind of pesticides. 
Not only that but also crops have higher quality. 
The teacher, however, asserts that this is not true because due to the way crops are interconnected, it is very easy for diseases to spread through the whole crop. 

Finally, the author puts forth the idea that with Hydroponics, less space is required to start a crop. 
On the other hand, the professor's stance is that because of the way Hydroponics work, more O2 is required and as a consequence,
a big space is required for the crops. 
Not only that, but also he manifests that the running and set up costs are very high, as a result, there is no chance for having a short-term benefit

#### Exercise 2
I totally agree with both John's and Lisa's beliefs. 
I hold the view that dystopian literature helps society to understand which social, economical, political and religious factors are making a negative impact in our daily lives. 
An essential argument perhaps is that nowadays people give more importance to privacy thanks to dystopian literature. 
This is thanks to the example of the "big brother" concept seen in 1984. 
As a result, social movements are promoting privacy and trying to avoid politicians to seek in our lives. 
Moreover, thanks to this kind of literature, we can understand how easily it is to follow political speeches which are not right and which promote violence or xenophobia, but we can't see it at first glance.
An example is given in animal farm book and the communist outbreak seen in it.

#### Exercise 2
##### Professor Thompson: "Today, let's discuss the nature vs. nurture debate. In your opinion, which has a greater impact on a person's behavior and personality – their genetic makeup or their upbringing and environment? Why?"

I strongly agree with Samantha's opinion whereas I respectfully disagree with Alex's one.
I hold the view that upbringing and environment play a crucial role in oneself character development.

An essential argument perhaps is that since you are a kid, the environment shows you which is the "correct" way to behave and relate with others. A great example is with your fathers and friends, both in school and at home. In those places, you see how your friends and parents treat each other. As a result, unconsciously, you start behaving the same way.
Moreover, environment also shapes your mental state. For example, when there is an economic crisis, you earn less money. As a consequence, you feel more stressed, and your way of being and behaving changes drastically.

#### Exercise 2
##### Professor Hawkins: "Fiction often serves as a mirror to society, reflecting its values, norms, and issues. Let's take a look at dystopian literature. How do you think this genre of fiction reflects concerns about our current society, and can it influence or shape the real world?"
I wholeheartedly agree with both John's and Lisa's opinions.

I hold the view that fiction is a great tool for depicting in which direction society is moving towards. An essential argument can be found in literature. Contemporary books such as 'Brave New World' or 1984 have introduced to society dystopian concepts such as 'the big brother' which have turn out to be an extremely accurate prediction of which shape of society we are creating.

Moreover thanks to dystopian fiction, individuals have raised awareness about how governments can influence ourselves and our decisions. An example can be found with propaganda. Thanks to this genre, it is easier for us to understand its goal. As a result, society has become more aware of this kind of invisible political influences.

#### Exercise 1

Both the reading and the lecture encompass about the meaning of art and the role photography plays in it. 
While the author of the reading argues that photography will never reach the same level of dedication and emotional impact than other forms of **artistic** expression like painting do, the lecturer opposes the claims presented in the reading. 
Her position is that photography can be considered another fine art. 

To begin with, according to the reading, photography can't be deemed to be fine art thanks to the easiness that digital cameras give to the photographers. 
This argument is challenged by the professor. She manifests that photography has a wide range of dedication levels. 
Photographers can be from very amateurs to very professionals. According to her, those that try to make fine art photography, need to make as much effort and need the same creativity as a painter. 

Moreover, the author indicates that painting generates a real emotional response to people. 
The professor, however, asserts that photography can also trigger an emotional response. 
She points out that one of the objectives that photography has is about expressing the vision of the photographer. 
As a result, this vision can trigger as well emotions to people. 

Finally the author puts forth the idea that painting and other forms of art are timeless and highly valuable for people, which is not the case for photography. 
On the other hand, the lecturer's stance is that photography is as valuable as other art expressions are. 
She argues that since 1924, there have been photography collections displayed, this as a consequence, shows how interested people have been in photography.

### Practice
#### Exercise 1
Both the reading and the lecture encompass World War I, the reason why it started, what could have happened if Germany had won and the unnecessary casualties involved. The author of the reading manifests that World War I was the result of an accident and because of the pre-existing alliances, a lot of countries had to join the fight. Also he or she thinks that an hypothetical win from Germany would have resulted in a country like the European Union. It can also be read that there were many unnecessary casualties because of bad leaders. The lecturer however opposes the claims presented in the article. His position is that it was not an unwanted war, that a Germany win wouldn't have lead to an European Union and the high amount of deaths were not result of bad leaders.

To begin with, according to the reading, the war was unwanted. In fact, it happened because of an accident and it escalated because there were alliances. The lecturer challenges this position. He manifests that it is not true that no one wanted a war. According to him, Germany has a large portion of blame, as it did not prevent the war when in fact, it had the power and position for doing it.

Moreover, the article argues that a Germany win would have lead to an European Union. The teacher however, asserts that this is a romantic idea. He manifests that the kaiser was not an openminded person. As a conclusion, it cannot be said that a country like the European Union would have been possible.

Finally, the article puts forth the idea that there were a lot of unnecessary deaths because of foolish generals and the lack of good leaders. The teacher's stance is that it was not because of that. He points out that the main reason for so many deaths to happen was because the armies had similar skills and sizes, among a lot of many other reasons.

### Practice
#### Exercise 1
Both the reading and the lecture encompass how the state should compensate those who have suffered unfair imprisonments. The author of the reading believes that the state should compensate economically wrongly convicted people. Either by giving them money or helping them in the job market. The lecturer opposes the claims made in the article. His position is that the state needs to defend its economical position. As a result it should not give any compensation to them apart from releasing them from jail.

To begin with, according to the reading, wrongly convicted people need to get compensated for having spent time in prison, which is not refundable. The only way to do that, is by giving them a lot of money in order to increase their quality of life. The professor, however, challenges this position. He manifests that the state gets economically harmed if it needs to compensate the convicted people. In fact, it looses more money than just leaving them in prison.

Moreover, the reading manifests that those that have been unfairly imprisoned, lack of any quality of life when they leave prison. This is because they have lost time and money to spend with friends and family. As a result, they need money to compensate all of this. The teacher, however, argues that this clashes with the economical and moral principles from the state. If the state does not get any benefit both morally and economically, they won't help that person.

Finally, the reading puts forth the idea that the imprisoned should retire as soon as possible. However the lecturer's stance is that the state won't allow that. He manifests that there is no good figure on how much to compensate in order to retire them. People could say that they just live in rich areas in order to get more money as compensation. Which would be an abuse to the system.
