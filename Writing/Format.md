### Mock exam 2
#### Exercise 1
Both the reading and the lecture encompass the concept of **the** death penalty and if it should or should not be banned.
Initially the professor manifests that the state should be responsible for those who cause disorder instead of just killing them. **On** the other hand, in the text we can read that the best option that the state has is to kill the offender in order to keep society safe.
Moreover, the teacher indicates that two thirds of the countries no longer support death penalty. Not only that but also, as a result, crime rates have decreased. In the reading however, it is said that death penalty would be the only way to keep crime rates low.
Finally, the teacher expresses that even in capital crimes where families have passed through a lot of suffering, death penalty is not the solution for it. Indeed, it does not relief the suffering, but also it is extended with the death of another human being. Thus, in the reading it is stated that the only way to find peace for the family would be by seeing the killer being executed.

#### Exercise 2
I totally agree with Megan's opinion whereas I respectfully disagree with Troy's one. I hold the view that economic inequality increases social injustice and impacts negatively **on** everyone **in** society. An essential argument perhaps is that by having inequality, purchasing power gets unequally distributed **in** society. As a result, poor people have less income and rich people have more. This turns out to be a vicious cycle ending in a huge gap between low and high classes. Not only that but also making the middle class disappear. Moreover, when inequality is present, the tax income for the country dwingles. As a result, there is less expenditure in essential services such as healthcare, infraestructure among many others.


#### Exercise 1
Both the lecture and the lecture encompass the concept of the "whipping boy" and its historical origins. 
The teacher manifests that there is no real evidences on the historical references that the reading illustrates. 
To begin with, the professor explains that Fitzpatrick was not Edward's fall guy. 
In fact, according to the teacher, sometimes even Edward VI got hit. However, in the reading it can be read that Fitzpatrick was the one punished when Edward VI commited crimes. 
Moreover, regarding Charles I and his whipping boy, in the lecture it is stated that the first reference towards William Murray being Charles I whipping boy appeared seventeen years after king's death. Indeed, according to the professor, Samuel R. the one who wrote those references, was the author of one of the earliest stories related to the whipping boys, which can turn out to be kind of suspicious. 
On the other hand, the reading affirms as a matter of fact, that William was Charles I whipping boy. 
Finally, "The Prince and the Pauper" which popularized the term, is pure fiction according to the teacher. As a result, in his opinion, it is important to take with a grain of salt the reading and what is explained there.
#### Exercise 2
I agree with Jessica's opinion whereas I respectfully disagree with Ethan's one. 
I hold the view that standardized testing is necessary and not only that but also, it must remain as the way to evaluate student on important matters. 
An essential argument perhaps is that by standardizing, we can filter, rank easily and in a better way students with an objective point of view. 
By setting objective performance indicators, we can fairly say that one student is better than another. Moreover, standarization gets rid off subjective evaluations which in fact, can turn out to be unfair. 
For example, saying that a student is better than another because of its creativity, is something that will depend on the examinator. 
As a result, depending on the examinator there will be different criterias, which will result in an unfair grading.
