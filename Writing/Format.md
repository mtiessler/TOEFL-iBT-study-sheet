### Mock exam 2
#### Exercise 1
Both the reading and the lecture encompass the concept of **the** death penalty and if it should or should not be banned.
Initially the professor manifests that the state should be responsible for those who cause disorder instead of just killing them. **On** the other hand, in the text we can read that the best option that the state has is to kill the offender in order to keep society safe.
Moreover, the teacher indicates that two thirds of the countries no longer support death penalty. Not only that but also, as a result, crime rates have decreased. In the reading however, it is said that death penalty would be the only way to keep crime rates low.
Finally, the teacher expresses that even in capital crimes where families have passed through a lot of suffering, death penalty is not the solution for it. Indeed, it does not relief the suffering, but also it is extended with the death of another human being. Thus, in the reading it is stated that the only way to find peace for the family would be by seeing the killer being executed.

#### Exercise 2
I totally agree with Megan's opinion whereas I respectfully disagree with Troy's one. 
I hold the view that economic inequality increases social injustice and impacts negatively **on** everyone **in** society. 
An essential argument perhaps is that by having inequality, purchasing power gets unequally distributed **in** society. 
As a result, poor people have less income and rich people have more. This turns out to be a vicious cycle ending in a huge gap between low and high classes. 
Not only that but also making the middle class disappear. Moreover, when inequality is present, the tax income for the country dwingles. 
As a result, there is less expenditure in essential services such as healthcare, infraestructure among many others.

### Mock exam 3
#### Exercise 1
Both the lecture and the **reading** encompass the concept of the "whipping boy" and its historical origins. 
The teacher manifests that there is no real **evidence**~~s~~ on the historical references that the reading illustrates. 
To begin with, the professor explains that Fitzpatrick was not Edward's fall guy. 
In fact, according to the teacher, sometimes even Edward VI got hit. However, in the reading it can be read that Fitzpatrick was the one punished when Edward VI commi**t**ted crimes. 
Moreover, regarding Charles I and his whipping boy, in the lecture it is stated that the first reference towards William Murray being Charles I whipping boy appeared seventeen years after **the** king's death. 
Indeed, according to the professor, Samuel R. the one who wrote those references, was the author of one of the earliest stories related to the whipping boys, which ~~can turn out to be kind of suspicious~~ can be debatable. 
On the other hand, the reading affirms as a matter of fact, that William was Charles I whipping boy. 
Finally, "The Prince and the Pauper" which popularized the term, is pure fiction according to the teacher. 
As a result, in his opinion, it is important to take with a grain of salt the reading and what is explained there.

#### Exercise 2
I agree with Jessica's opinion whereas I respectfully disagree with Ethan's one. 
I hold the view that standardized testing is necessary and not only that but also, it must remain as the way to evaluate student**s** on important matters. 
An essential argument perhaps is that by standardizing, we can filter, rank easily and in a better way students with an objective point of view. 
By setting objective performance indicators, we can fairly say that one student is better than another. Moreover, standar**d**ization gets rid off subjective evaluations which in fact, can turn out to be unfair. 
For example, saying that a student is better than another because of its creativity, is something that will depend on the ~~examinator~~ examiner. 
As a result, depending on the **examiner** there will be different **criteria**~~s~~, which will result in an unfair grading.

### Practice 
#### Exercise 1
Both the lecture and the reading encompass the concept of "Fast fashion" and the role the Gen Z youngsters are playing in it. 
To begin with, the teacher manifests that the Gen Z is fully committed towards fighting climate change, whereas the reading illustrates that the Gen Z people do not care at all about that. 
Moreover, the professor opines that they are trying, more than ever, to shift shopping habits. She adds that it is very common nowadays to see them buying second hand clothes in online platforms such as "Vinted" and as a result, fast fashion is being replaced by an eco friendly movement. 
On the other hand, the reading exemplifies this young people as people who are just seeking cheap and accessible clothing for their own sake without caring about the impact they may generate. 
Finally, the teacher illustrates how social media is in fact having a positive impact in the Gen Z people. She states that nowadays TikTok has fashion trends that promote the recycling of old clothes. 
On the other hand, in the reading it can be read that young people contribute towards fast fashion, and as a result, they are constantly buying new clothes which will be used for creating new posts in the social media.

##### Correction
The reading passage discusses the negative aspects of "fast fashion," highlighting its impact on both people and the environment. 
It mentions low wages for factory workers, excessive waste production, and environmental pollution, while also expressing concerns about Gen Z's apparent disregard for these issues.
In contrast, the lecture challenges some of these assumptions and offers a more positive perspective on Gen Z's approach to fashion. 
The lecturer acknowledges the presence of Gen Z activists in climate change movements like Extinction Rebellion and their increasing involvement in politics. 
The lecture emphasizes that Gen Z is not just talking about change but actively altering their shopping behaviors.
The lecture provides examples of these changes, such as the growing popularity of renting items and buying second-hand clothing from platforms like Depop and Vinted. 
Gen Z is portrayed as seeking individuality and eco-friendly options rather than mindlessly supporting fast fashion. 
Social media, particularly TikTok, plays a role in promoting recycling and sustainable fashion trends among Gen Z.

### Practice
#### Exercise 2
I completely agree with both David and Rachel's opinions. In addition to those, I consider that one of the majors strengths of democracy is that it **encompasses** a huge amount of different ideologies. 
As a result, progress comes from extracting the best ideas from each one of them. 
However, I would say that one of the greatest pitfalls from democracy is the easiness in which every adult can vote. 
Consequently, this can lead to situations where people without any basic knowledge of how the democratic system works, can vote without knowing what they are really voting. 
As a result, the results of elections can be random. 
For **addressing** this issue I consider that people should do a crash course about democracy and the political parties before being able to vote.

##### Correction
Response briefly mentions a strength and a weakness of democracy, but it lacks in-depth analysis or examples to support your points. You could provide more detailed explanations to strengthen your argument.
