Do you ever find yourself wanting to talk about the intensity or degree of an action or an adverb (a word that gives more information about a verb)?
Have you ever wanted to draw attention to a particular part of what you're saying?
If you have wanted to do either of these things, could you? 
This is where this flashcard will come in handy!
Today you will learn:
- How to use some degree adverbs and some focus adverbs like a pro 
- The mistakes to avoid 
- …and some interesting trivia!
# Don't forget!
Degree adverbs => make a situation clearer => especially for time or effort
_=> I've **almost** finished._
_=> I'm **nearly** ready._
_=> We have **quite** far to go._
_=> You failed because you didn’t study hard **enough.**

Focus adverbs => emphasize a part of what we are saying  
_=> I've **only** lost my glasses. => I didn't lose anything else._
_=> I've lost my **only** glasses. => I don't have another pair._
_=> **Only** I could lose two pairs of glasses in one week! => Nobody else could do this._
# Explanations & Examples
**Degree Adverbs…**
=> help make what we are saying clear.
=> some examples of degree adverbs are: _almost, nearly, quite, just, too, enough, hardly, scarcely, completely, very, so, extremely_
=> degree adverbs generally come after the verb :
_We're **almost** there._
_I've **nearly** finished._
_He's **quite** fast._
_I don't have **enough** time._
_She is **extremely** annoying.

Note also **too**, which needs to be followed by an adjective:
_It's **too** expensive._ => I cannot buy it.
_He's **too** slow._ => He will lose.

**Focus Adverbs…**
=> are used to emphasize certain parts of what we are saying. 
=> if we were speaking, these parts would be stressed.
=> some examples of focus adverbs are: _at least, at any rate, in any case, if nothing else, only, also, as well, too, even, but, exactly, simply, mostly_
_**Also,** I love it._
_I **also** love it._
_I love it **also.**_
_I **also** have to clean before I can go out._
_**Only** I love you. => I'm the only one who loves you._
_I **only** love you. => I don't love anyone else._
_**At least** you have each other._
_You have each other, **at least.**_
=> as a general rule, single words are flexible enough to go near the beginning or end of a phrase
=> if there are several words, they are generally used in the middle of a sentence to join two clauses:
_We need to do something now about climate change and, **if nothing else,** we must persuade people to stop using plastic._
_And so, you really should give up smoking and, **in any case,** you shouldn't be smoking in the house._
# Look out!
**LOOK OUT! Degree adverbs need to go after the verb.**
_It's extremely hot._
_They're rather expensive._
